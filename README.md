## ‚ùì Project Questions and Significance

### **Question 1:**  
**Is there a correlation between certain baby names and specific ethnic groups?**

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
Exploring the association between baby names and ethnic groups can shed light on cultural traditions and naming conventions within diverse communities. Names often carry significant cultural heritage, and certain names may be predominantly chosen within specific ethnic groups. Understanding these patterns can be valuable for sociological research, marketing strategies, and fostering cultural appreciation. The dataset includes information segmented by sex and ethnic group, making it suitable for this type of analysis.

### **Question 2:**  
**Is there a correlation between baby name popularity and major events or celebrities during that time?(Analytical)**

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
This analytical question explores whether external cultural influences, such as major news events, popular media, or celebrity prominence, have a measurable impact on the frequency of specific baby names over time. By analyzing trends in baby name popularity and comparing them to timelines of significant events (e.g., a celebrity becoming widely known, a movie release, a political figure rising in prominence), the analysis seeks to uncover patterns of cause-and-effect or influence in naming behavior.
